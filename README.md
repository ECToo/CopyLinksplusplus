# CopyLinks++

CopyLinks++ is a Firefox Addon to copy links to clipboard from the open pages.
It is able to filter links by a list of destination domains.
It can also collect magnet links.


Copylinks++ extracts all links from all opened tabs, sorts them, removes duplicates, and copies them to clipboard.

Copylinks++ allow you to choose where to copy from:
- current tab
- all tabs in current window
- all tabs in all windows

Copylinks++ allow you to filter what to copy:
- all links
- magnet links
- links to listed domains (ie: links to cyberlocker files)

Options page let you:
- choose action for toolbar button
- decide actions to show in contextual menu
- set your own list of domains

List of destination domains when saving is automatically sorted and duplicates are removed.

You can add domain to list with contextual menu item (current domain or link domain)
